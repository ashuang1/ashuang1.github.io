            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Austin Huang, and I am a student at Duke University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Statistics. 
                I am interested in software systems, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. 
                I am involved with Duke Symphony Orchestra (first violin), Asian Intervarsity (Small Group Coordinator, Small Group Leader), 
                Duke Club Volleyball (outside hitter), and work as an undergraduate teaching assistant (CS230, CS316).
                In my free time, I enjoy running, playing basketball, journaling, and baking.</p>
            <!-- I am interested in programming and attended the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute in the summer of 2021. 
            I love using my hands, so I worked with a licensed builder to rebuild a deck and repair and pressure wash a fence.
            I have been the concertmaster of the SC Philharmonic Youth Orchestra for 3 years and have won its concerto competition. 
            I really enjoy playing chess, playing basketball, running, gaming, and joking around with friends. -->
