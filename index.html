            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Austin Huang, and I am a first year student at Duke University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I am interested in computer vision and its applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I was first exposed to Java in my sophomore computer programming class, and I have grown to enjoy the methodical form of problem solving required. I play violin in the Duke Symphony Orchestra and also work as an elementary school tutor for literacy and math.</p>
            <!-- I am interested in programming and attended the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute in the summer of 2021. 
            I love using my hands, so I worked with a licensed builder to rebuild a deck and repair and pressure wash a fence.
            I have been the concertmaster of the SC Philharmonic Youth Orchestra for 3 years and have won its concerto competition. 
            I really enjoy playing chess, playing basketball, running, gaming, and joking around with friends. -->
