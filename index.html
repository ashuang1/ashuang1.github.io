            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Austin Huang, and I am a junior at Duke University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics. I am interested in computer vision and its applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I play violin in the Duke Symphony Orchestra, am involved with Asian Intervarsity as a Small Group Leader, am in Duke Club Volleyball, and am a teaching assistant for CS230.</p>
            <!-- I am interested in programming and attended the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute in the summer of 2021. 
            I love using my hands, so I worked with a licensed builder to rebuild a deck and repair and pressure wash a fence.
            I have been the concertmaster of the SC Philharmonic Youth Orchestra for 3 years and have won its concerto competition. 
            I really enjoy playing chess, playing basketball, running, gaming, and joking around with friends. -->
